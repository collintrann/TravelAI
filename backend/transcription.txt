Is Acadia National Park the best one in the States? Well, if you're planning a nature adventure to Maine, here are 9 things you need to do on Island. At Lo-Tide, only walk to Bar Harbor Island. Make sure you walk back though before high tide, otherwise you're stranded. High-caprecipice or B-hive trail, depending on the time of year you visit. Rent an e-bike in town and take it to the carriage trails for a nature rollercoaster ride and get a Maine lobster roll from any shack. If Maine Blueberry Pies on the menu, get dessert. Sand Beach 
is great but usually crowded so get there early if you're trying to beach. Drive or hike up Cadillac Mountain, you'll need to make a reservation for this. Take a boat tour to see Mount Desert Island from the water. Drive to the other harbors like Seal and Southwest for the naturalest notebook in Seal Harbor, the coolest bookstore I've ever been to. And then get drinks at Batson River Fish Camp at the Claremont Hotel. Bar Harbor though is such a vibe we went for the 4th of July and had the best time.
